# Cyber-Showdown
This game, "Cyber Showdown", was created during the summer of 2020 using Java.
Cyber Showdown is a 2D platformer with the goal of surviving waves of robots and eventually defeating the Master Robot!

# Game Explanation

In Cyber Showdown, the user plays as a robot with the ability to fire bullets. During the game, the player must survive hoards of robots by dodging and/or destroying these robots using the players bullets. If the player collides with an enemy, the player loses a heart. The player starts with 3 hearts, but can collect more hearts during the game. Each wave is 30 seconds long, with 10 total waves, each with either a different number of robots or a new robot varient. As the player progresses, the waves will get increasingly more difficult. The final wave will consist of a boss battle. 

## Perks

During each wave, perks will randomly appear on the map. The player may pick up these perks in order to help the player survive the wave. There are 5 perks in the game:
* Bullet Perk: The player is given an upgraded bullet at random ("Fast Bullet" or "Big Bullet")
* Health Perk: The player gains one additional heart
* Nuke Perk: The player destroys all enemies in the area simultaneously
* Speed Perk: The players speed temporarily increases for a short amount of time
* God Perk: The player is invincible for a short amount of time

## Enemy

There are a total of 5 different enemies the player will encounter, including a final boss enemy:
* Basic Robot: This enemy is considered the easiest to deal with. The enemy chases after the player, however, it can only move in straight directions
* Advanced Robot: Similar to the Basic Robot, except this robot can make diagonal movements, making it reach the player more efficently
* Tank Robot: A slower robot, but requires the player to hit this robot with 2 bullets to destroy it
* Speed Robot: This enemy is considered the hardest to deal with (besides the boss). This robot can moves at a speed faster than all other robots, including the player
